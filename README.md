## 📝 Description
An easy to use, single page site that provides an interactive map with current cases by country, location-based testing site information, national headlines and helpful links to get resources and help we can all use.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## 💾 Installation
This is app is a straightfoward, frontend product. Clone this repository and run ``` index.html ``` in your local browser to test and develop it further. My instance of this group project is currently hosted on my site 👉 [Covid-19 Tracker](https://metcalf.dev/Covid-19-Tracker/)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## 📲 Usage
Users are able to interact with the map thanks to the **Mapbox** API technology by clicking, dragging and zooming. By using the visitor's IP address, all data is populated using just their state. To accommodate for privacy or adblockers, a dropdown menu allows visitors to select their state manually. **No data is stored** in any servers or *localstorage*. For now, the map data is global but the rest is US only.
